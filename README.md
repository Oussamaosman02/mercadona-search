# Mercadona Product Search

This is an example of how you can perform a search for a Mercadona product.

## Why?

Mercadona api itself donÂ´t have a public method for searching products (or i did not saw it).
With this method, you can search for products and have returned their id, that you can use to search with it more information about the product in their official api.

## Try it

To try this, you should download or open a CodeSpace on this repo.

Then, when you are in the folder, you have to install the packages:

~~~bash
pnpm i
~~~

or with npm

~~~bash
npm i
~~~

or with yarn

~~~bash
yarn
~~~

Then, you can run `{pnpm/npm/yarn} start`, this will show you the products that match the query 'patatas fritas' (fries).

If you go to `index.js` file, you can change this query in the `queryArray` constant, just change the content and introduce what you want to search.
